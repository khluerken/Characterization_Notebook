# Characterization_Notebook
Second draft of characterization parameters, first draft of a notebook detailing them. 

Currently, the notebook has revised estimations for Half Angle, Ground Sample Distance, and Focal Length. I need to verify what altitudes imaging will be taking place at, and as result have not finalized Field of View. Dynamic range is also pending; resources list a "high dynamic range" but give no numerical value for that range.
